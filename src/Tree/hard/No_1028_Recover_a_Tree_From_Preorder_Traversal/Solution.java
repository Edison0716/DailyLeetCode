 * Description:
 * We run a preorder depth first search on the root of a binary tree.
 *
 * At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  (If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D+1.  The depth of the root node is 0.)
 *
 * If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
 *
 * Given the output S of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
 * Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: "1-2--3---4-5--6---7"
 * Output: [1,2,5,3,null,6,null,4,null,7]
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: "1-401--349---90--88"
 * Output: [1,401,null,349,88,90]
 * Difficulty: Hard
